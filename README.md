## Tello Drone A* Path Planning in Python
Welcome to the Tello_drone_Astar_python_path_planning repository. This project is dedicated to integrating A* path planning algorithms with the DJI Tello drone, using Python as the primary programming language. Our aim is to ensure smooth navigation and advanced maneuverability for the Tello drone by leveraging the capabilities of the A* algorithm.


## Prerequisites and Installation


Before diving into the source code and running the provided Python scripts, it's essential to set up the appropriate environment:
1.Dependencies & Libraries:

Ensure you've installed all the necessary libraries and dependencies. The list might vary based on the system and the exact nature of the project, so refer to the requirements.txt file .
2.System Requirements:

Depending on your operating system and its configuration, you might need to install certain libraries or tools in advance. We recommend checking the compatibility and versions to avoid any runtime issues.

3.Installation Steps: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.General notes:

mpl_toolkits is actually a part of matplotlib, so you don't need to install it separately. Including matplotlib should suffice.
heapq, random, time, math, and os are part of the Python Standard Library since they come with Python by default.

## Getting Started
Once the environment is set up:
1. Power up and connect your DJI Tello drone.
2. run the python script.
